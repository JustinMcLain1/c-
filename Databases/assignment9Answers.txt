1.2) the result from running the SELECT statement is "Empty Set" This is because
	Transcation allows all the changes made to the statement are temporary until the transcation is over

1.5) The result from the Select statement outputs the data From the input into the Table named Taco
	it will output the inputted data because the transaction was commited meaning what we entered can now be saved to the database
 

2.4) The result from teh select statement outputs the values that were edited prior to it even though we haven't commit it
	the transaction still shows us what the output will look like to know if we entered in everything correctly

2.5)  THe result from this statement was the output that occured prior to the transaction starting because once again 
	transaction makes all of the next inputs temporary until they are commited if they are rolled back it will undo 
	all command inputs made after the start of the transaction.

3) THE program stopped with error 1205, What is happening is, some other thread is holding a record lock on some record
	 (you're updating every record in the table!) for too long, and your thread is being timed out. And with transaction \
	they must be atomic trying to do this breaks the atomicness of it because there will no longer be just one value for pk
	which is the primary key in terms of a transaction this is known as Atomicity which is the idea that either all operations of 
	the transaction are implemented properly or none are and it also breaks consistency which is that no execution of a transaction in isolation
	preserves the conistency of the database ***** with no other transaction executing concurrently**** these ar eteh ACID Properties
