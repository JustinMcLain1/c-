My contributions fo the group project included bug fixing which was done during and out of
group meetings where we would typically meet twice or three times a week. I also helped with
the schema for the database with the entire group. Also group management with deciding meetings
deciding progression of the project, Assigning rolls, helping with questions etc etc Programming for 
some of the sign up pages as well.

Gavin: Contributed to the schema, made the song search, sign up functionality which includes
names, account balance, the free queue and priority queue functions, as well as the song select

Eric: Contributed to the schema, helped with design as well as the SQL and the song selection within
our database, he also helped to fix some stuff with sign up and contributed ideas as to how it would function

Dale: contributedc to the schema, designed the DJ interface as well as the ascending and decending ordering,
Helped to also design the functionality for the web page

Fareed: Contributed to the schema, did pretty much all the design for the html/css as well as helping with
functonality for the sign up page, home page, and searching.

One of the things I learned from this assignment wasn't anything in regarding to coding. If this was a solo
project it could have easily been done by ones self, I believe the soul purpose of this project was to understand
group work, and arrangmenet with time management, As thats what is important outside is functionality with a large
group of people.  

Contructive feedback: none
