compliation of c++ in turing or hopper

g++ -c -I/user/include mariadb program.cc 
  // -c is used to compile without linking 

gcc -c -I/user/including/mariadb program.c

these make object files with .o extension

you must have the header file in the .cc program or .c program
another reason it doesnt work is there is a syntax erropr in code
or there is a typo

FOR linking

g++ -o program program.o -lmariadb 
 // the -o takes the next arugment as the output filename

gcc -o program program.o -lmariadb

linking erros

failed to list one of the object files
failed to tell the linker to include a library that is needed

linker path does not include the directory your libraary is located in
header file has a different declaratiuon than what is implemented

./program will run the program
